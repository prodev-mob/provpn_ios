## Introduction

ProVPN ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our ProVPN mobile application (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **VPN Profile Information**: When you create or configure VPN profiles, we may store:
  - Profile names
  - Server addresses
  - Usernames and passwords (stored locally on your device)
  - Custom DNS settings
  - Private key passwords (if required)

### Information Automatically Collected

- **Device Information**: We may collect information about your device, including:
  - Device model and operating system version

- **IP Address Information**: When you use the IP checker feature, the App may query third-party services to determine your public IP address and approximate location. This information is displayed to you but is not stored by us.

### Information from Third-Party Services

- **VPN Server List**: The App fetches available VPN servers from our API endpoint (`http://68.183.94.242:3500/api/servers`). This process may involve:
  - Downloading server configuration files (.ovpn files)
  - Caching server information locally

  - Your public IP address
  - Approximate geographic location
  - ISP information

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

1. **Provide VPN Services**: Establish and maintain VPN connections to the servers you select

3. **Troubleshoot Issues**: Diagnose and resolve connection problems (when Developer Mode is enabled)
4. **Display Information**: Show your current IP address and connection status
5. **Cache Data**: Store server configurations locally for offline use and improved performance

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

- **Device Storage**: All VPN profiles, credentials, and settings are stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults and file system storage
- **Cache Directory**: Downloaded VPN configuration files are cached in the App's cache directory (`Library/Caches/VPNConfigs/`)
